I am Mich√®le, a data scientist based in London.

I was born and raised in Lebanon, and have lived and worked in two of the world's most beautiful cities, Paris and London.

Like everyone else, I am amazed by the accuracy of Google's image recognition and Amazon's shopping recommendations. My interest in AI led me to read Cathy O'Neil's *Weapons of Math Destruction* which opened my eyes to the ethical aspect of machine learning and how, if not built and used mindfully, machine learning algorithms can reinforce preexisting social inequality, and drew me further to the subject.

I got increasingly interested in machine learning, and read more on the subject. This eventually led me to want to try my hand out at building and training my own models which I started exploring whenever I had some free time.

In autumn 2020, after 5 years working in tech audit for a major financial services company, I decided to take the leap. I left my job and set out on a journey to refresh my programming and maths skills and to learn more about machine learning and deep learning.
